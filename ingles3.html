<br>ACTIVIDAD SOLUCION <br>

<br>#1:TREAT OTHERS THE WAY
YOU WISH TO BE TREATED
The good old Golden Rule says it all:
empathy, tolerance and peace. This
principle teaches you to love yourself and
love others. It spans cultures and faiths
and is a universal age old concept which
cant fail!
                  <div class="imgin1"></div>

<br>
#2: LISTEN TO HEAR WHAT OTHERS HAVE TO SAY, NOT TO
SPEAK
Engage in dialogue with an open mind and the real will to listen to others.
Only then will you be able to understand each other and build bridges.
Change cannot happen and peace cannot be established if people are
unable to communicate with others; to listen to their experiences and
views and show empathy, understanding and compassion.

                     <div class="imgin2"></div>

<br>
#3: ACCEPT DIFFERENCE OF OPINION
We all have different opinions and we may not all agree
on the same things. Building compromise and mutual
understanding is incredibly important. Sometimes we
simply need to agree to disagree and recognise that there
are different beliefs and forms of expression other than
our own.
                        <div class="imgin3"></div>

<br>
#4: DO NOT FIGHT VIOLENCE WITH VIOLENCE 
Violence is never the answer. Peace can only be brought
through free will, dialogue, empathy and forgiveness. Do
not stoop to same level as someone who is violent and
therefore continue the vicious cycle. This does not change
anything.

<br>Karen: No, I didn’t. I went with my friend Jessica. She has some friends living there.
